Questions You Need to Ask Stakeholders
What fields define a settled vs. trial claim?

What field defines payout amount?

Can we get a standard template for PDF documents or any tool currently used to extract data from them?

What ImageRight metadata is available for mapping documents to claims?

Are the LexisNexis or Verdict Analyzer data feeds integrated?

Can we receive some sample documents with label mapping for training?

What is the development environment (Jupyter, GCP, APIs)?

What are the data retention and labeling policies?

âœ… Final Thoughts
Youâ€™re thinking like a full-stack ML engineer: from data ingestion to deployment.

Your primary blockers are:

Unstructured data extraction

Inconsistent document formats

Unclear output expectations from stakeholders

We can solve this by first:

Finalizing what fields are required

Getting sample structured and unstructured data

Creating a data mapping sheet

Building a baseline dummy model

Let me know â€” would you like me to generate a BRD, MoM, process flow, Excel mapping sheet, or stakeholder questionnaire next?

or shall i ask if some one can walk through us from these process flow because attribute label information i ma not able to get for building the model either table data or pdf,image,email

Yes, you're absolutely right â€” and asking for a walkthrough of the process flow is the most professional and effective step at this point.

Hereâ€™s how you can politely and clearly ask your stakeholder:

ðŸ“© Professional Email/Message Template: Request for Process Flow Walkthrough
Subject: Request for Process Flow Walkthrough & Clarification on Data Labeling

Dear [Stakeholderâ€™s Name],

Following our recent discussions, Iâ€™ve started reviewing the internal tables and the document-based data (PDFs, images, emails) stored in ImageRight. However, to ensure we can build a reliable predictive model, Iâ€™m finding it difficult to identify:

The attributes (features) relevant for modeling,

The label logic for determining whether a claim is settled or goes to trial,

And how these data points are mapped across structured tables and unstructured documents.

Would it be possible to schedule a walkthrough of the current claim intake and evaluation process flow, ideally with someone who is familiar with:

How information is captured across different sources (emails, PDFs, verdict forms),

What internal rules or fields are used for assigning trial/settlement flags,

And whether there is a standard document structure (template) used for different claim types.

This would really help us align our data understanding with the business process and ensure the modeling logic is valid and traceable.

Looking forward to your guidance on this.
