Questions You Need to Ask Stakeholders
What fields define a settled vs. trial claim?

What field defines payout amount?

Can we get a standard template for PDF documents or any tool currently used to extract data from them?

What ImageRight metadata is available for mapping documents to claims?

Are the LexisNexis or Verdict Analyzer data feeds integrated?

Can we receive some sample documents with label mapping for training?

What is the development environment (Jupyter, GCP, APIs)?

What are the data retention and labeling policies?

‚úÖ Final Thoughts
You‚Äôre thinking like a full-stack ML engineer: from data ingestion to deployment.

Your primary blockers are:

Unstructured data extraction

Inconsistent document formats

Unclear output expectations from stakeholders

We can solve this by first:

Finalizing what fields are required

Getting sample structured and unstructured data

Creating a data mapping sheet

Building a baseline dummy model

Let me know ‚Äî would you like me to generate a BRD, MoM, process flow, Excel mapping sheet, or stakeholder questionnaire next?







You said:
or shall i ask if some one can walk through us from these process flow because attribute label information i ma not able to get for building the model either table data or pdf,image,email


ChatGPT said:
Yes, you're absolutely right ‚Äî and asking for a walkthrough of the process flow is the most professional and effective step at this point.

Here‚Äôs how you can politely and clearly ask your stakeholder:

üì© Professional Email/Message Template: Request for Process Flow Walkthrough
Subject: Request for Process Flow Walkthrough & Clarification on Data Labeling

Dear [Stakeholder‚Äôs Name],

Following our recent discussions, I‚Äôve started reviewing the internal tables and the document-based data (PDFs, images, emails) stored in ImageRight. However, to ensure we can build a reliable predictive model, I‚Äôm finding it difficult to identify:

The attributes (features) relevant for modeling,

The label logic for determining whether a claim is settled or goes to trial,

And how these data points are mapped across structured tables and unstructured documents.

Would it be possible to schedule a walkthrough of the current claim intake and evaluation process flow, ideally with someone who is familiar with:

How information is captured across different sources (emails, PDFs, verdict forms),

What internal rules or fields are used for assigning trial/settlement flags,

And whether there is a standard document structure (template) used for different claim types.

This would really help us align our data understanding with the business process and ensure the modeling logic is valid and traceable.

Looking forward to your guidance on this.

Questions:
from the structured attribute list, I can only identify fields like plaintiff demand, but I am unclear which attributes correspond to actual payment made or propensity to pay.

I would appreciate help identifying which features represent target variables for:

Binary classification (i.e., payment made or not), and

Regression (i.e., payment amount).


 1. Clarifying the Target Fields
‚ÄúWhich field in the data should we use to define whether a payment has been made or not ‚Äî for building the propensity model?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich field in the structured data reflects the actual indemnity payment amount or settlement amount?‚Äù

‚ÄúShould we use Plaintiff Demand as the target for the amount model, or is there another field that reflects the final paid amount?‚Äù
Many of the attributes appear to originate from unstructured documents. Is there a field-document mapping or an extracted version of those fields?
###
As I reviewed the attribute list and supporting documentation, I had a few clarifying questions before proceeding with modeling:

Could you help identify which fields are to be used as targets for:

Propensity to pay (Yes/No)

Payment amount (regression)?

Are there other fields beyond plaintiff demand that indicate actual payment made to the claimant?

#$$$$$
libililty:
I‚Äôve reviewed the dataset that was recently shared, and I‚Äôd like to confirm my understanding regarding the target fields for the two key modeling objectives:

Verdict Propensity (Classification Model)
Based on the field verdict_flag (0/1), I assume this represents whether a jury verdict occurred or not, and would be used as the classification target to estimate the likelihood (propensity) of a case going to verdict.

Payout Prediction (Regression Model)
For payout modeling, I assume verdict_amount represents the amount awarded if the case goes to verdict, and this field would serve as the target for the payout prediction model.

Could you kindly confirm if this understanding is correct?
Also, please let me know if there are any additional fields you would like us to consider for either the classification or regression
