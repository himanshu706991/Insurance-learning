Subject: Review of Client Inputs – Exposure & Experience Premium Logic & Data Structure
Hi [Project Manager's Name],

We hope you're doing well.

We have reviewed the latest document and information shared by the client regarding the exposure and experience premium pricing model. Below is a consolidated summary of our understanding, key observations, and areas where further clarification is needed to support the development process.

Overview of What Has Been Shared
The document shared by the client is structured into three main sections:

Page 1: Table & Attribute Mapping
This section lists the source tables and corresponding attributes intended for use in the premium calculation.

During our review, we observed:

Some attribute names mentioned do not exactly match those in the provided SQL tables.

It is unclear whether the missing attributes are renamed versions, derived fields, or exist in related tables.

Clarification is needed to confirm if all fields referenced in the calculation logic are available in the current datasets.

Page 2: Discounts and Other Inputs
This section covers discount/surcharge rules and refers to specific tables and attributes.

We noted that:

A few attributes are mentioned that are not present in the specified tables.

Several fields are marked as manually entered or sourced from Excel, but it’s not clear whether:

These inputs are required for exposure premium calculations.

They serve as temporary placeholders or are part of a manual override process.

It would be helpful to understand the logic or business reasoning behind these manually entered values.

Page 3: Exposure Premium Calculation (Excel-Based)
This section includes the full logic for exposure premium, implemented entirely using Excel formulas.

The logic appears to be complex, with multiple layered calculations.

Since the source data resides in SQL and our implementation is planned using SQL/Python, we recommend that this logic be shared in SQL format or as structured pseudocode.

This is particularly important because:

Translating complex Excel logic to SQL without sufficient clarity can introduce misinterpretation or errors.

The exposure premium is a critical target, and misalignment between logic and data can impact model accuracy.

A SQL-based version will ensure better traceability, reproducibility, and validation.

Additional Observations Based on Previous Discussions
The source tables are currently being populated through Excel uploads. However:

We have not received any documentation or SQL logic showing how these Excel files are ingested into the tables.

It remains unclear how the Excel columns are mapped to table fields and whether any transformation or validation steps are performed.

Experience premium logic has not been shared yet. When available, we recommend it also be shared in SQL or structured form.

For unstructured data (from ImageRight), we are still waiting for:

A complete list of attributes being extracted.

Clarification on where those extracted fields are being stored for downstream usage.

Note on Target Variables
As of now, the exposure premium and experience premium are the two confirmed target variables for modeling.
However, we understand that additional targets may be introduced in the future, as this remains an ongoing discussion with stakeholders. We will keep this in mind and remain flexible in our implementation plan to accommodate further requirements.

Summary of Follow-Up Needs from the Client
To enable smooth development and integration, the following clarifications are required:

SQL logic or ETL transformation steps for ingesting Excel data into the source tables.

Clarification on unmatched or missing fields referenced in pages 1 and 2.

A SQL-based version (or structured pseudocode) of the exposure premium logic.

Experience premium calculation logic (once available), preferably in SQL.

Attribute list for ImageRight (unstructured data) and confirmation of storage destination.

Confirmation on whether additional target metrics are expected, and how they may be defined.

Please let us know if you’d like us to send a follow-up to the client with these points, or if you prefer to wait for the next round of inputs. We’re happy to assist further as needed.

Best regards,
##########3
One critical point we would like to highlight is the need for clarity on the physician-level entity for whom the premiums and related calculations are being derived.

Since the exposure and experience premium logic is ultimately applied at the physician level, we assume there must be a structured way to identify and profile each physician, typically via the NPI (National Provider Identifier) or similar unique ID.

However, based on the current documentation and shared tables, it is not yet clear:

Which table(s) contain the physician-level records.

Whether NPI or another identifier is being used as the primary key.

How other datasets (e.g., claims, endorsements, submissions, discounts) are being linked back to individual physicians.

To move forward effectively with modeling and ensure proper target association, we request:

Confirmation of the physician reference/master table.

Schema and sample structure of this table.

Details on how all incoming data will be joined at the physician level using NPI or another consistent identifier.

This will help ensure that all predictions and premium calculations are properly aligned and interpretable at the physician granularity level.

####
We have received several premium-related factors such as:

Base Rate

Class Factor

Claim-Made Factor

Claim-Made Year

One-Year Adjustment Factor

Limit Factor

Class Layer Factor

Layer 3 ILF Factor

Charity Factor

Expense Factor

While we understand these are used in the exposure premium calculation, it would be extremely helpful to have a business-level explanation or definition of each of these terms.

Specifically, we would like to understand:

What each factor represents in the context of physician pricing or underwriting.

How they influence or adjust the final premium.

Whether any of these are standardized across the industry or specific to this product/organization.

If there are any rules, ranges, or constraints associated with these fields.

How these factors interact with other variables (e.g., physician specialty, limit, region).

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Meeting Agenda / Stakeholder Questions
1. Source Understanding for QlikView Report
Can you help us identify the exact data source for the QlikView report?

Which SQL tables or views are being used to generate this report?

Are there any intermediate transformation layers (ETL scripts, joins, filters) between the source and the QlikView report?

Can we get access to the underlying logic or transformation rules (e.g., stored procedures or QlikView load script)?

Is there any documentation or data lineage available for this report?

2. Document Understanding from ImageRight System
From ImageRight, we are receiving multiple types of claim documents — do we have a defined template or document type classification for these?

For different injury types, do we need to extract different sets of attributes? If yes, can you share any sample mappings or templates?

Attributes like rating (e.g., 1–5) — what do these numbers represent? Are they manual inputs or derived fields?

Are there any data extraction guidelines or heuristics available (e.g., keyword-based or section-based parsing)?

Is there any OCR or NLP system already in place for parsing these documents?

3. Modeling and Data Preparation
For the model execution, is it expected to run daily on new claims only, or should it also re-evaluate older claims with updates?

Do we already have a labeling logic or criteria for:

Whether the case went to trial

Whether it was won by plaintiff or defendant

Can we get the disposition code mapping and what each code means in business terms?

Are PSL / HSL fields directly available or derived from other fields?

4. Additional Operational and System-Level Questions
Can we get sample dummy data or a sandbox environment for development and testing?

Are there any data quality issues or known gaps in current fields?

Who are the point-of-contact owners for:

QlikView report logic

Claims document classification

Final approval or validation of model outputs?

Having this clarity will not only ensure proper model integration but also help us build transparent and explainable logic that aligns with business expectations.

Hi [Colleague’s Name],

Thanks again for sharing the insurance data model diagram. You've done a great job covering core operational areas like policy, claims, and billing. Based on further analysis and alignment with the broader business context—especially around underwriting and actuarial needs—we’d like to suggest a few enhancements to improve the model’s utility and coverage.

Here are the key additions that could further enrich the data structure:

1. Reinsurance Treaty Domain (Currently Missing)
To support treaty-level actuarial and financial visibility:

Entities: Treaty Agreement, Reinsurer, Ceding Company, Treaty Coverage, Recovery Amounts, Seeded Premiums, Claim-Treaty Mapping

Benefit: Enables CFO-level visibility into net loss positions and cost-sharing from reinsurance

2. Expanded Physician/Hospital Provider Domain
For underwriting, benchmarking, and malpractice analysis:

Physician Attributes: NPI, specialization, licensure, affiliations

Hospital Attributes: Facility type, ownership, accreditation, performance metrics

Risk Data: Claim involvement, risk scores, flags

Benefit: Enables provider-level segmentation and risk profiling

3. Claim-to-Treaty Reconciliation Layer
To ensure complete mapping and reconciliation of claims with reinsurance:

Entities: Claim Reinsurance Ledger, Financial Snapshot

Benefit: Supports audit, reserving, and external reporting alignment

4. Metadata Layer for Data Lineage and Audit Trails
To strengthen compliance and traceability:

Entities: Source-to-Target Mapping, ETL Audit Fields

Benefit: Supports regulated audit environments and debugging

5. Schema Naming and Design Recommendations
To promote modular, scalable implementation:

Suggest standardized naming like: dm_treaty_summary, fact_claim_payment_summary, xref_claim_treaty_recovery

Benefit: Supports reporting-readiness and technical clarity

Happy to walk through any of these in more detail or collaborate on refining further.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$4
Got it — thanks for explaining in detail. What your client has shared is essentially a data dictionary + source-to-target mapping style workbook that documents all the different data domains (Premium, Losses, Claims, Treaty, etc.), the cubes/queries/tables where they exist, and the key financial/insurance measures that are tracked.

Here’s how you can summarize and explain this Excel file back to your client (or internally), so you show understanding without getting lost in all the details:

Summary of Excel File Received

The workbook appears to be a data source inventory and definition document covering multiple insurance domains (premium, loss, treaty, and claims). It is structured into different tabs, each serving a distinct purpose:

Data Definitions Tab

Contains field-level metadata for key insurance measures and dimensions.

Includes financial dimensions such as:

Written Premium, Change in Premium, Earned/Unwritten Premium, Insurance Payable

Ceded Commission, Ceded Paid Loss, Ceded Paid Expense, Insurance Recoverable

Case Reserves (loss & expense), Changes in Reserves

Each field is accompanied by a definition and linked to seeded cube measures (e.g., Loss Cube, Premium Cube) for reporting.

Loss / Premium Query Tabs

Capture how premium and loss data are queried across different treaty/program structures.

Key attributes: Treaty ID, Treaty Year, Accident Year, Segment, Company, Claim Number, Policy Number.

Notes are provided for how specific values are derived or exceptions are handled.

Data Source Tabs (e.g., “2025_axis”)

Document the actual source systems / data marts from which data is pulled.

Example: Claim Data Mart table, Premium Standard table, Embedded RLP table.

Includes metadata such as: whether a source is active or inactive, and whether it supports premium vs loss reporting.

Claim and Premium-Specific Queries

Multiple dedicated queries for line-of-business-specific or treaty-specific needs:

CUL Claim, OFIC Claim, KNR Premium/Losses, RLP Premium/Claim, WCV Premium, MGL Claim/Premium, CAB Loss, PSL Claim (Physician), etc.

These represent different insurance products/LOBs (Lines of Business) where separate queries and cubes exist to handle specialized reporting requirements.

Key Observations

The document provides both business definitions and technical mappings.

Heavy emphasis on treaty reinsurance reporting (ceded premium, ceded losses, commissions, recoverables).

Specialized claims datasets exist for different lines of business (Physicians, Workers Comp, Medical GL, etc.).

This structure indicates that the client has a federated data landscape, where multiple cubes/queries feed into financial reporting.

Next Steps / Suggested Questions

When responding back, you don’t need to go field by field. Instead, you can acknowledge the coverage and ask clarifying questions. For example:

Confirm Data Scope:

“Does this Excel cover the full data landscape, or only treaty/ceded-related reporting?”

Clarify Line of Business Queries:

“Each claim/premium query (e.g., CUL, OFIC, PSL) seems to represent a distinct LOB. Should we treat them as separate cubes, or are they consolidated at a higher level?”

Integration Point:

“How do these sources roll up into the enterprise financial view (i.e., reconciliation across Premium, Loss, and Claim tabs)?”

👉 So, in short, you can explain:
“This file is essentially a data definitions + data source mapping document, listing out how premium, loss, treaty, and claims are defined, what financial measures exist, and which queries or data marts provide them. It covers both field-level definitions (Data Definitions tab) and the corresponding queries/cubes per line of business (Loss, Premium, Claims, Treaty). The multiple LOB-specific queries (e.g., PSL Claim, MGL Premium, KNR Losses) indicate domain-specific cubes for different insurance products.”

Would you like me to also draft a short professional email reply to your client, summarizing this (2–3 lines max) so you can acknowledge receipt + show understanding without going into too much detail?

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a clean, formal summary you can send back or use for your own understanding when discussing with the client:

Summary of Excel File Review

Thank you for sharing the Excel file. After reviewing, I noted that it contains multiple tabs, each serving a different purpose:

Data Definitions

Provides a glossary of financial and insurance-related fields (e.g., policy number, claim number, treaty year, accident year).

Includes definitions of seeded cube metrics such as premium, loss, commission, recoverable, reserves, expenses.

Captures financial dimensions like written premium, change in premium, paid loss, recoverables, case reserves.

Acts as the foundational reference for how data is structured and should be interpreted across reports.

Premium / Loss / Transaction Queries

Separate tabs contain SQL-style queries or mappings for premium and loss transactions.

Tables and fields are tied to treaty- and company-level reporting (e.g., treaty year, accident year, treaty name, ceded values).

This appears to be the core reporting logic behind financial and claims-related cubes.

Data Sources (PSM, Claims, Premium Tables)

Identifies backend tables/views such as 2025_axis, claim_data_mart, and premium_data_mart.

Specifies whether the source is active, and the type of metric (premium, loss, claim).

Provides traceability to where each data point originates.

LOB-Specific Queries

Multiple tabs (e.g., CUL claim, OFIC claim, KNR losses, RPL premium, MGL claim/premium, CAB loss, PSL claim, Physician’s Access) appear to represent line-of-business–specific queries.

Each query is tailored for its respective product or line, mapping to premiums, claims, and losses relevant to that business segment.

Key Observations / Next Steps

The Excel acts as a metadata and query repository—defining business terms, aligning them with financial dimensions, and linking them to source systems.

It covers both enterprise-wide metrics (seeded premium, ceded loss, recoverables) and LOB-level queries (e.g., physician, hospital, workers’ comp, specialty).

To move forward, it would help to clarify from the client:

Which of these queries/data sources are actively used in production reporting vs. provided only as reference?

Whether the seeded cube definitions are already standardized across business lines, or if there are LOB-specific variations that need harmonization.

The role of each line-of-business query (e.g., CUL, OFIC, PSL) — are these standalone cubes, or are they intended to be merged into a single consolidated data model?

While reviewing the document, I came across a few terms and abbreviations that I wanted to clarify for my own understanding. Based on the organization’s documentation and context, here is the interpretation I gathered:

KNR Premium – Refers to Kidnap and Ransom insurance policies.

KR Code – Appears to be an internal code associated with KNR-related entries.

RLP Standalone Premium – Refers to premiums associated with Regulatory Liability Products, such as cyber and regulatory liability insurance.

MGL – Stands for Management Liability policy.

CUL – Commercial Umbrella Liability.

WCV – Workers’ Compensation and Employer Liability.

Loss Capping – Refers to the practice of limiting the recognition of loss for a claim or group of claims.

OFIC – Refers to Ortho Forum Insurance Company (as mentioned in the mutual context).
PSL_EXCLAIM – Physician and Surgeon Liability – Excess Claim.


1. Structure of the Excel File (What each sheet represents)

Data Definitions tab

Contains field names + business definitions.

Includes financial dimensions (like written premium, change in premium, ceded premium, insurance recoverable, loss reserves).

Also includes keys/identifiers: company, claim number, policy number, treaty year, accident year.

Mentions seeded cube match (loss/premium) → looks like a reconciliation/matching process between source cubes for loss vs. premium.

Notes column has clarifications.

Loss Query / Premium Query / Transaction Query tabs

Show queries or data extracts (used in reporting/analytics).

Contain treaty → company → translation mappings, notes, and whether data is active/round-off.

Essentially “query definitions” for how data is being pulled from source systems.

Data Source tab

Shows source tables/views (e.g., 2025_axis, claim_data_mark, view_*).

Lists treaty type, year, active flag.

Helps track where each metric is pulled from.

CUL / CGL / OFIC / KNR / RLP / WCV / MGL / PSL tabs

Each corresponds to a line of business or product:

CUL = Commercial Umbrella Liability

CGL = Commercial General Liability (likely a typo in your note, but they usually pair)

OFIC = Ortho Forum Insurance Context (mutual context)

KNR = Kidnap & Ransom

RLP = Regulatory Liability Product (standard, cyber, regulatory liability)

WCV = Workers Compensation & Employer Liability

MGL = Management Liability

PSL = Physicians & Surgeons Liability (excess coverage)

Each sheet contains premium, claims, and losses for that product.

2. What This Workbook Actually Is

This looks like a combined metadata + reconciliation workbook used by the client’s Finance/Actuarial/Analytics teams to:

Define fields clearly (so reporting teams don’t misinterpret “premium” vs “written premium” vs “ceded premium”).

Map queries to extract data from source systems (Axis, claim tables, cube views).

Provide a per-product view (each sheet like MGL, WCV, KNR, etc. is basically a product’s premium/loss dataset).

Standardize calculations across teams.

3. How to Summarize Back to Client / Team

When they ask you to “go through and summarize,” they’re not expecting you to know every insurance term — they want you to demonstrate that you’ve understood the structure and purpose of the file.

Here’s a clean executive-level summary you could give back:

Draft Summary for Client Discussion

The provided Excel workbook appears to serve as both a data dictionary and a data mapping/reconciliation reference across multiple insurance products and source systems.

Key observations:

Data Definitions (Core tab)

Contains field-level definitions, including identifiers (company, policy, claim, treaty year, accident year) and financial dimensions (written premium, ceded premium, insurance recoverables, reserves, expenses, etc.).

Mentions seeded cube matching logic (premium vs loss reconciliation).

Query Tabs (Loss / Premium / Transactions)

Document the queries used to extract/report on financial metrics.

Contain treaty and company mappings, translation notes, and flags (active/round-off).

Data Source Mapping

Shows which systems/tables (e.g., Axis, Claim Data Mark, seeded cubes) are being used for each dataset.

Identifies whether data is active and which treaty year it applies to.

Product-Specific Tabs (CUL, KNR, RLP, MGL, WCV, PSL, OFIC)

Each tab represents a specific line of business or insurance product.

Premium, claims, and losses are tracked separately for each.

Conclusion
The Excel serves as a central reference to:

Standardize field definitions across Finance/Actuarial/Analytics teams.

Provide transparency on source queries and mappings.

Break down financial/claims data by product line.

4. Next Steps / What You Can Ask Client

When you go back to client, instead of saying “I don’t understand,” you can ask structured clarifying questions:

On Data Definitions:

Should this tab be treated as the authoritative data dictionary for all downstream reporting?

On Queries:

Are the “Loss Query” and “Premium Query” tabs actual SQL extracts, or conceptual query mappings?

On Data Sources:

Which of these sources (Axis, Claim Data Mark, Cube Views) are considered golden sources vs supporting?

On Product Tabs:

Are these tabs sample extracts of actual data, or just mapping sheets for reconciliation?

############################################333
Perfect! Here’s the full, updated summary email with all points included: data sources, T factor, UW factor, dashboard/industry studies, underwriter-provided inputs, open questions, and the roadmap reflecting physician first, hospital next. The wording is neutral, professional, and reads like a human summary.

Subject: Summary of Data Layers and Next Steps

Hi [Manager’s Name],

Following our recent discussion and the review of the data flow diagrams, I have summarized my understanding of the current data layers, sources, and next steps from both a business analysis and data science perspective.

1. Data Sources & Flow

Submission Data: Historical losses, historical exposure, and current exposure from the Cognisure tool, provided as Excel exports. These can be replicated into Snowflake for consolidated access.

Rating Parameters / Base Rate & Class Factor: Provided as Excel exports, including the T factor. These form part of the ASRA tables and can also be replicated into Snowflake.

Underwriting (UW) Model Factors: Composed of multiple components:

Industry Studies: Updates such as trend, LDF, frequency, and other model parameters are provided quarterly by the client.

NPI Scoring Algorithm, External Data Gathering, Risk/Loss Process: Maintained and provided by the underwriter, feeding into the UW Model Factor by NPI.

Clarification Needed: Understanding the methods and calculations applied to NPI scoring, external data, and risk/loss process.

Dashboard Inputs: Daily pricing information is available via the dashboard.

2. External Data & Loss Process

External data from the underwriter includes NPI scoring results, physician lists, and DHC procedure data.

The loss process involves cleaning, mapping, and trending claims to calculate exposure premium and experience premium.

Questions to Clarify:

How are NPI scores calculated?

What external data sources are included, and how are they processed?

How is the risk/loss process applied to generate exposure trends and development?

3. Open Considerations for Modeling

Should initial replication focus on input data only, or also include pre-calculated output fields (premium calculations)?

Multi-layer calculations (base → adjusted → exposure → experience premiums) may require clarification on whether they will remain in Excel or be migrated to SQL/Snowflake.

For modeling purposes, the target variable (Y) and master data structure (X) need confirmation.

Candidate features for modeling may include historical loss ratios, exposures, class factors, peer underwriting factors, NPI scores, industry study adjustments, and dashboard pricing trends.

Prediction granularity should be clarified (policy, physician/NPI, or portfolio level).

4. Suggested Next Steps / Roadmap

Replicate submission data, rating parameters including T factor, and UW Model Factor components into Snowflake as the first step.

Schedule discussion with underwriter to clarify methods for NPI scoring, external data, and risk/loss process.

Confirm master data definitions, including key identifiers and feature fields for modeling.

Gather details about industry studies methodology and dashboard inputs.

Plan a phased approach:

Physician-level modeling first: Replicate inputs, clarify NPI scoring and loss process, and prepare consolidated dataset for physician exposure and experience premium.

Hospital-level (HPL) modeling next: Once physician-level logic and dataset are finalized, extend the methodology to hospital-level exposure and experience premium.

Understand whether Excel calculations will be migrated to SQL/Snowflake or remain external.

Build dashboards and intermediate datasets for analysis and validation.

Please review and let me know if this summary aligns with your understanding or if any adjustments are needed before tomorrow’s client meeting.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

This version:

Fully includes T factor, UW Model Factor sources, and underwriter-provided inputs.

Highlights open questions for NPI scoring, external data, and risk/loss process.

Includes sequence of work: physicians first, hospital next.

Neutral wording — it summarizes, does not instruct, and keeps action items clear.

If you want, I can also create a condensed 1-page version for senior stakeholders, focusing only on key points and action items for a quick read.

Do you want me to prepare that as well?

You said:
Now my biggest confusion is when I am taking this raw table, I will be taking only input data field or output also because ultimately we are doing the calculation of the exposure premiums, underwriting factors, and PI scoring, all other fields calculating on the excel only. So after calculating all these things, then we are going to feed into the snowflake or before doing all these calculations as input raw data when it is coming, then we are going to feed that. This question still remains same as it is.
ChatGPT said:

Got it — this is a critical clarification for your meeting. You need to distinguish between:

Raw input data: the fields you get directly from Cognisure, ASRA tables (base rate, class factor, T factor), dashboards, and underwriter feeds before any calculations are applied.

Calculated output fields: exposure premium, experience premium, UW factors, NPI scores — fields that are currently computed in Excel using multi-layer formulas or underwriter logic.

The key question for the client/underwriter is:

Should the Snowflake tables store only the raw input fields, with Excel handling all calculations externally, or

Should Snowflake tables already contain the calculated fields after exposure/experience premium, UW factor, and NPI scoring calculations?

For your email/meeting, you can phrase it naturally like this:

Open Question for Clarification:
Currently, several fields (exposure premium, experience premium, UW factor, NPI scoring) are calculated in Excel. For Snowflake replication:

Are we expected to load only the raw input data and leave the calculations in Excel, or

Should Snowflake tables already include the calculated output fields after applying Excel formulas / underwriter logic?

Understanding this will help define the data pipeline, what needs to be automated in SQL/Snowflake, and what will remain in Excel.

If you want, I can update your full summary email and include this as a clear point under Open Considerations for Modeling so your PM sees this as a key clarification for tomorrow’s discussion.
