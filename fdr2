Allow new data sources to be added easily.

2. Document Extraction (ImageRight PDFs)

Link each field to the PDF it came from.

Maintain a mapping table for traceability.

3. Data Transformation
Standardize formats like dates, currency, status codes across sources.

Apply rules to calculate premium, claim, deductible amounts.

Allow logic to be applied after data is centralized.

Support yearly treaty logic (10–12 new treaties per year) through configuration.

4. Currency Conversion and Rounding
Convert currencies using exchange rate tables.

Handle rounding differences and log mismatches.

Skip conversion if broker already provided final values.

5. Reconciliation
Match policy premium with actual financial transactions.

Match system data with broker data and flag differences.

Log any mismatches with time, source, and details.

6. Modeling Features
Identify target variable (e.g., claim paid or not) for ML models.

Prepare dataset for modeling (e.g., payment propensity).

Export model-ready data for data science teams.

7. Reporting and Dashboards
Create dashboards for claim trends, premium earned/unearned, treaty performance.

Support filters by line of business, geography, policyholder, etc.

8. Audit and Governance
Track every transformation applied to data.

Keep logs of rule version, who made changes, and when.

Ensure data is traceable from source to final output.

Store start/end date, deductible, retention, payout rules per treaty.
