Project: Reinsurance Treaty Reconciliation & Financial Integration
Client: [Client Name]
Prepared By: [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Final Date of Meeting]
Meetings Covered: Initial Stakeholder Sync, Weekly Working Sessions, Daily Deep Dives


1. Objectives Discussed
Build an automated, centralized system for treaty-level financial reconciliation.

Integrate multiple source systems (Velocity, Oasis, WAC, Actuarial Excel, Reinsurance Cube).

Enable daily or monthly policy and claim-level visibility into ceded loss and financial postings.

Implement exception handling and root cause tracking to replace current Excel/email-based workflows.

Support financial closure timelines and align with quarterly treaty reinsurance reports.

2. Key Systems & Data Sources
System	Description
Velocity	Core policy, claim, and transaction system
Oasis (MPLS ERP)	General Ledger, policy financial mappings
WAC	Workers' Compensation data source
IBNR (Actuarial)	Segment/state-level reserves; shared via Excel
Reinsurance Cube	Stores treaty configuration: retention, share %, eligibility
Salesforce / Workday	Used by accounting teams for validations and approvals

3. Functional Areas Covered
ðŸ”„ Reconciliation Process (Current State)
Manual using Excel across multiple teams.

Data pulled from Workday, Salesforce, Velocity monthly.

Reconciliation efforts are slow, siloed, and lack traceability.

No proper audit trail or exception management exists.

Data Integration
Monthly ingestion from third-party claim systems into EDW.

No current daily-level integration for claims or financial data.

Velocity and Oasis need to be source-of-truth for calculations and GL posting.

Treaty Calculation
Every treaty has distinct logic (e.g., cede %, attachment point, retention).

~10â€“12 treaties signed per year.

Need parameterization and version control for each treatyâ€™s logic.

New treaties signed at year-end must be calculated in Q1 of the next year.

Treaties applied at policy/claim/hospital/provider level.

Exception Management
Needed to track:

Eligibility mismatches (wrong LOB/state)

Missing fields

Invalid configurations

Must support:

Status (Open/In Progress/Resolved)

Reason codes

Owner assignments

UI or reporting dashboard

ðŸ§¾ Adjustments & Financial Closure
Adjustments (e.g., broker) still captured in Velocity before GL posting.

Closure timeline:

12-day closure window

5â€“7 day buffer before reinsurance reports

Adjustments must be tracked and applied before posting to ledger.

ðŸ“Š Reporting & Governance
Reports needed:

Loss Summary

Ceded Loss Calculation

Exception Log

Treaty Run Audit Trail

Closure Status

Reports drive:

Management decisions

GL reconciliation

Quarterly treaty reporting

4. Challenges Identified
Current Excel-based process is inefficient and error-prone.

No centralized tool for multi-source matching.

Delay in root cause identification.

Adjustments not tracked consistently.

Cession logic hardcoded and lacks reusability.

No versioning of treaty scripts or logic.

IBNR shared in Excel with no auto integration.

6. Next Steps
Consolidate treaty logic into a parameter-driven config file

Begin documentation of functional requirements

Schedule session to review closure timelines and dependencies

Review existing loss summary and adjustment scripts

Discuss feasibility of daily reconciliation and reporting
